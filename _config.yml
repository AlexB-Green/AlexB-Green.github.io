          My role evolved to having increased responsibility of projects taking leadership of the end-to-end process from delegation to project-management. I also gained more responsbility in providing the best pratice for how we work with GCP. Some notable work examples: 
          - Built a content clustering tool that utilise clustering algorithms to build a segmentation of viewers and TV shows for media panning purposes
          - Led client Geo experimentations which included planning of the experiments using power analysis techniques to execution of the experiments through synthetic control methods as well as presentations back to the client.
          - Built a academic-style research study utilising regression-based models to show how different TV dayparts carry more effectiveness at driving online traffic
          - Assisted the build of a new first-party dataset within the business and led the analytical work that focused on use-case implementation of the dataset
          - Led client Addressable lift pilots, utilsing 1:1 ip matching to look at incremental uplift solutions

          My role focused on helping to develop tools for clients to help measure the effect of their TV ads, creating analytical reports utilising first party data to prove the value of TV as well as helping to guide third party providers in executing measurement pilots that prove the value that TV creates. Some notable work examples are: 
          - Built a subtitle's tool that utilises NLP to look at words and their prevalence in TV shows to help with show targetting
          - Assisted building a tool that visualises advertiser impressions against a competitor set they decide upon
          - Created automated pipelines for pulling in first-party data and querying the data
