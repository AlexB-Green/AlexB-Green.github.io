      Alongside my interests in Data Science,  some of my other interests and hobbies are:
      - Dancing: I have danced since I was young, and my passion is contemporary dance with elements of street and
        modern. I have danced competitively and won the UK Janet Cram Awards (2012) and have danced in the
        Royal Albert Hall and have been a finalist at the All-England UK Finals, UK Tap Awards and UK Ballet
        Awards.
      - Cinematography - I am an avid movie watcher and love to talk films and going into the meaning behind artistic choices
