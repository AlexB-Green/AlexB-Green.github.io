                  modern. I have danced competitively and won the UK Janet Cram Awards (2012) and have danced in the
                  Royal Albert Hall and have been a finalist at the All-England UK Finals, UK Tap Awards and UK Ballet
                  Awards.
      - Film: I have a long-standing interest to cinema and films. In particular, sound design and cinematography
