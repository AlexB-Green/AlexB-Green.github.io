          My role evolved to include increased project responsibility, where I took the lead on end-to-end processes, from delegation to project management. I also played a key role in establishing best practices for how the team should leverage cloud platforms like Google Cloud. Some notable work examples include:
          - Developed a content clustering tool using machine learning algorithms to segment users and products for targeted strategies.
          - Designed an academic-style research study using regression models to analyze the impact of different time periods on driving web traffic, providing actionable insights.
          - Contributed to the creation of a new first-party dataset, leading the analytical work to implement its use cases within the organization.
          - Led experimental pilots for clients, applying power analysis to define control group sizes and executing A/B testing to assess the effectiveness of various strategies.

         My role expanded to include increased client responsibility, where I worked with a diverse range of clients and used the analytical tools developed by the team to create compelling insights on how their marketing strategies impacted their business outcomes. Additionally, I took on more responsibility in training new team members following the expansion of our team. Some notable work examples include:
          - Conducted a cross-domain analysis on the relationship between advertising volumes and audience engagement, which was crucial for the launch of a new service.
          - Assisted in the development of a product to automate contextual targeting, improving advertising efficiency.
          - Built forecasting models to predict engagement metrics for new and returning content, enhancing decision-making processes.
          - Led experimental studies, including planning and executing power analysis and synthetic control methods, to evaluate the impact of marketing strategies. I also presented findings and actionable insights to clients.

          My role focused on developing analytical tools and reports to measure the impact of advertising on business outcomes. I utilized first-party data to generate insights that demonstrated the value of marketing efforts to clients. Additionally, I collaborated with third-party providers to guide the execution of measurement pilots, helping to quantify and prove the effectiveness of advertising strategies. Some notable work examples are: 
          - Developed a tool using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze word prevalence in content, aiding in targeted audience segmentation.
          - Assisted in creating a tool to visualize key metrics, comparing advertiser performance against competitor benchmarks defined by clients.
          - Built automated data pipelines to extract, query, and visualize first-party data, streamlining the reporting process through a dynamic dashboard.
