about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I am a highly motivated individual currently working in a data science role in London, with a strong background in problem-solving, analytical thinking, and communication developed across both public and media sectors. However, my long-standing role as a support carer for my sister has inspired a deep passion for pursuing a more person-centred and impactful career in occupational therapy. I have witnessed first-hand the powerful role occupational therapists play in improving independence and quality of life. I am now focused on developing the practical and theoretical foundation needed to contribute meaningfully to this field.
