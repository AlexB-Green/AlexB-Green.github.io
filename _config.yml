          My role evolved to having increased responsibility of projects taking leadership of the end-to-end process from delegation to project-management. I also gained more responsbility in providing the best pratice for how we work with GCP. Some noteable work examples: 
          - Built a content clustering tool that utilise clustering algorithms to build a segmentation of viewers and TV shows for media panning purposes
          - Led client Geo experimentations from planning of the experiments through the use of power analysis to execution of the experiments through synthetic control methods
          - Built a academic-style research study utilising regression-based models to show how different TV dayparts carry more effectiveness at driving online traffic
          - Assisted the build of a new first-party dataset within the business and led the analytical work that focused on use-case implementation

          My role expanded to having increased developer responsibility as well as led the training of new team members with the expansion of the team. Some notable work examples:

          - Assisted the development of an advertising product that helps automate contextual targetting
          - Built forecasting models looking at viewing figures for new & returning shows

          My role focused on helping to develop tools for clients to help measure the effect of their TV ads, creating analytical reports utilising first party data to prove the value of TV as well as helping to guide third party providers in executing measurement pilots that prove the value that TV creates. Some notable work examples are: 
          - Built a subtitle's tool that utilises NLP to look at words and their prevalence in TV shows to help with show targetting
          - Assisted building a tool that shows advertiser impressions against a competitor set
          - Create automated pipelines for pulling in first-party data and querying the data

                  modern. I have danced competitively and won the UK Janet Cram Awards (2012) and have danced in the
                  Royal Albert Hall and have been a finalist at the All-England UK Finals, UK Tap Awards and UK Ballet
                  Awards.
