          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

            Easiest to see through the lens of the ITV behaviours where three behaviours in particular stand out. People find Alex to be a great collaborator; infectious with his enthusiasm and curiosity, someone who is full of energy and drive, taking the initiative and proactively offering help and support to others when needed.
